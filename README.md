# Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem

## Overview
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  
Cities are represented as randomly generated points on a 2D plane. The algorithm searches for the shortest route that visits all cities and returns to the starting point.

The notebook includes:
- generation of cities and distance matrix,
- creation of an initial population,
- fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation,
- visualization of route improvements across generations.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how the algorithm improves the quality of solutions over time, showing shorter and more efficient routes across generations.
